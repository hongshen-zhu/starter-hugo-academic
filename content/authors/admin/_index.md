I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the East Asia Center of the University of Virginia. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for the Study of Contemporary China at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on authoritarian politics, comparative political economy, and Chinese bureaucracy and governance. I am interested in using high-frequency and geo-located data to analyze political decision-making. My work has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Bloomberg, and other outlets.

I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science and M.A. in Economics from Duke University. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Warwick.
