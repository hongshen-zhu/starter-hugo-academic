I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the East Asia Center of the [University of Virginia](https://eastasiacenter.as.virginia.edu/hongshen-zhu). Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for the Study of Contemporary China at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://cscc.sas.upenn.edu/people/hongshen_zhu). My research focuses on authoritarian politics, comparative political economy, and Chinese bureaucracy and governance. I am interested in using high-frequency and geo-located data to analyze political decision-making. My work has been featured in the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-braces-for-deadly-covid-wave-after-loosening-controls-11670506411), [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/zero-covid-exit-china-reopening-investigation-05e1bf6d14e3b77ade26b719093ac43b), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-14/why-china-will-see-more-economic-policy-u-turns-under-xi-jinping), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/10/how-economists-have-underestimated-chinese-consumption), and other outlets.

I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science and M.A. in Economics from [Duke University](https://polisci.duke.edu/). Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).
