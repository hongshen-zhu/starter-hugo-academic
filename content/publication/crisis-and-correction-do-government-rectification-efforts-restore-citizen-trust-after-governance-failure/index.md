title: "Crisis and Correction: Do Government Rectification Efforts Restore
  Citizen Trust After Governance Failure?"
publication_types:
  - "3"
abstract: "In a substantial literature on trust in government, the impact on
  trust of governance crises and government efforts to fix its mistakes is
  understudied and unmeasured. We analyze a cycle of crises and contribute a
  theory of heterogeneous response to correction efforts. We study this in
  China, an authoritarian state with high trust in government. We leverage the
  occurrence of two exogenous shocks—a vaccine crisis and a subsequent
  government correction effort—with administration of a face-to-face, nationally
  representative survey in 2018. We theorize that response to government
  correction efforts depends on prior exposure to similar governance failures.
  Using days from the crisis as an instrument, we find that: (1) the more
  salient the crisis, the lower the trust in government; and (2) government
  correction increases trust for citizens experiencing the 2018 crisis as an
  isolated occurrence but not for those who experienced a similar crisis and
  correction in 2016."
