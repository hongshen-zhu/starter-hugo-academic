title: "Applying Insights from China: A Typology for Subnational Comparative Politics"

abstract: >
  Recent surveys in studies of Chinese politics indicate that few concepts from
  this sub- field have gained traction in comparative politics or other social
  sciences. In this article, we draw on theories of subnational analysis and
  comparison to argue that even in a strong, authoritarian state such as
  China—often considered to be ”unique”—there are some policy areas where the
  preferences of the center are less important. In these cases, theories and
  findings may be applicable to other contexts. We introduce a typology to show
  that careful consideration of the interests and information of national and
  subnational actors can allow us to identify generalizable policy areas.
  Depending on the particular configuration, we can then predict how the central
  state evaluates local actors, variations in local implementation, and the
  potential for generalizability to set- tings beyond China. We apply this
  typology to several policy areas—social stability, social security,
  environmental governance, and political selection—to derive expecta- tions
  about the behavior of central and local states, and identify when researchers
  can (and cannot) treat subnational units as independent. We argue that this
  typology gives researchers a tool to construct their theoretical framework
  more precisely and interpret the implications of their findings more broadly
  for future subnational research.
