abstract: While previous research on policy implementation focused on the
  constraints and incentives defined by the mandate of the policy itself, this
  study highlights the additional constraints imposed by externalities arising
  from other conflicting mandates. The pursuit of each policy goal is
  constrained by how it affects other mandates with comparable importance,
  leading to the emergence of balanced efforts and the avoidance of
  over-compliance. By aggregating location data from 1.1 billion mobile devices
  in China, this study gauges the intensity of the lockdown policies in cities
  during China's 2020 COVID-19 epidemic. The study employs event studies and a
  staggered difference-in-differences design to exploit the natural experiment
  of the end of a conflicting mandate against "Zero COVID", the poverty
  elimination campaign. I found that cities which needed to balance poverty
  elimination and pandemic control succeeded in both goals with significantly
  lower lockdown costs. A reduction of 40 percent in the severity of their
  COVID-19 lockdown measures is observed, compared to a counterfactual scenario
  where only the Zero COVID mandate was present.
