abstract: Despite the lack of electoral accountability and median voter’s
  redistributive prefer- ences, China has built an expanding welfare system that
  is set to include most citizens. Why does China defy the conventional
  prediction of an exclusive autocratic welfare state? This paper argues that
  the state adopts a “demand-driven strategy” where the redistribution effort
  varies with the expected collective action of economic losers. Us- ing legacy
  state-owned enterprises (SOE) as an instrumental variable for laid-off SOE
  workers in Chinese counties, the paper finds that preexisting urban grievances
  explain local states’ later efforts to establish a welfare state. The effect
  dominates effects of realized protests, suggesting that structural knowledge
  about potential grievances is more important in formulating policy concessions
  than situational knowledge like revealed grievances in authoritarian states.
