title: "Never Meet Your Heroes: Community Policing in Contemporary China"

abstract: "In autocracies, police are tasked with both providing law and order
  for citizens and monitoring and repressing political opposition for the
  regime. For ordinary citizens, the local police represent the most common and
  recognizable face of coercive state power, yet, we have little systematic
  knowledge about how everyday, street-level polic- ing impacts citizen’s
  political attitudes and behaviors in modern autocracies. We study these
  relationships in the context of contemporary China, a high-capacity
  authoritar- ian state that, in recent years, has invested heavily in
  developing its domestic security apparatus. Drawing on literatures that
  emphasize the physical and spatial dimensions of autocratic power, we propose
  that citizens living geographically closer to police sta- tions will be both
  more exposed to, and reminded of, police violence, incompetence, or
  malfeasance—issues endemic to local policing in many autocratic states. As a
  result, they will be less likely to trust and participate in community
  political institutions. Us- ing data from a recent nationally-representative,
  probability sample survey and highly precise, geo-referenced information on
  the location of police stations, we find evidence to support our theory:
  citizens who live closer to police stations (1) feel less safe, (2) express
  lower levels of trust in community political institutions, and (3) participate
  less in neighborhood political affairs. Our findings indicate that the growing
  investment in the physical police state may further exacerbate local
  information capture and the alienation of citizens from the system."
