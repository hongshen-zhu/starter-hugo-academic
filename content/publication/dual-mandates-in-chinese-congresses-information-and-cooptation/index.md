abstract: "Survey data suggest that a high proportion of Chinese congress
  delegates sit concurrently in two or more congresses. While dual mandates are
  not unusual in democracies, the literature has failed to notice their
  existence in China, let alone theorize or analyze them. We turn to the
  political science literature on assemblies under authoritarianism to guide our
  analysis of survey data for 3,008 county congress delegates, half of whom are
  concurrent ones. We show that dual mandates amplify some voices and not others
  in ways consistent with two perspectives in the literature. Dual mandates
  amplify information from citizens at the grassroots upward toward governments:
  More delegates with deep community roots representing poor, rural, remote
  districts sit concurrently in county and lower-level congresses. Dual mandates
  also coopt influential groups posing a potential challenge to ruling party
  power: They amplify the influence of private entrepreneurs, more of whom sit
  concurrently in county and prestigious higher-level congresses."
