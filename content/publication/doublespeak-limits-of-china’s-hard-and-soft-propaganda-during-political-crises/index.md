title: "Doublespeak: Limits of China’s Hard and Soft Propaganda during Political
  Crises"
publication_types:
  - "3"
abstract: This research note examines authoritarian propaganda strategies’
  effectiveness during political crises and policy changes. Although extensive
  research showcases the efficacy of propaganda, limited attention has been
  given to its shortcomings. We posit that various propaganda strategies,
  including “hard” and “soft” rhetoric, have significant limitations during
  political crises. Hard propaganda’s heavy-handed slogans could sig- nal regime
  strength but may also legitimize “rightful resistance” against local author-
  ities, limiting its protest-deterrence effects. Soft propaganda may lose
  persuasiveness due to presenting contradictory arguments during policy
  changes. We leverage China’s COVID policy reversal and political turmoil to
  conduct an original, pre-registered survey experiment in December 2022. Our
  findings reveal that pro-reopening hard propaganda weakens its
  protest-deterrence effects by reinforcing belief in protest righ- teousness.
  Moreover, inconsistent soft propaganda lowers public evaluations of China’s
  COVID response, diminishing its persuasive effects. Our study highlights
  significant limitations of authoritarian propaganda, particularly during
  political crises when they are most needed.
